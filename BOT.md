# BOT

### Bot Platform Implementation (20%)

Most codes are implemented in /TemaBot/Controller to integrate the bot platform implementation.

### Use Cases Refinement (10%)

We read the feedback of our use cases. We are suggested to send the weekly report pictures to users via mattermost instead of sending a link. We did some reseach and decided to use links. There are 2 reasons here:

1. For reports in web pages, there are more details and pictures can be shown to users, the users can get more information about their process.

2. Reports in web pages are easy to share by copying the url.

### Mocking infrastructure (30%)

Mocking data is in /TeamBot/test/mock.

### Selenium testing of each use case (30%)

We use puppeteer to do the use case testing. Tests are in /TeamBot/test.

### Screencast (10%)
