## Report
### The problem our bot solved
Our Teambot is a group progress tracker that monitors group members' activities on Github and presents the statistics on a weekly basis. By simply interacting with Teambot on Mattermost, we can create the tracker and receive weekly updates reporting our pull requests, number of commits, change of lines of code, and etc. Teambot is definitely beneficial for group communication and management as it saves us time from organizing meetings to report progress individually and it motivates group members to participate more actively as well.
### Primary features and screenshots
#### Monitor initialization
In the public channel Town Square, post a message that includes a keyword such as "create", "monitor", etc.

#### Sending out weekly reports 

Every Friday, you'll get a direct message summarizing your activities of the week from Teambot: <br />
![report](https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/14814/files/59fc8680-1aa1-11ea-9da2-60e2da222779) <br />

There's a section where the manager can click on a group member's username and view his or her individual report: <br />
![individual](https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/14814/files/6fbf7b00-1aa4-11ea-9395-4113a56a5479 =250*100) <br />
A group member's report looks similar to a manager's, but it doens't show up any information of others, as we did take privacy into consideration. <br />

#### Short answers for your query

Teambot can answer your questions with respect to your Github activities directly so that ou don't have to look up a piece of information from the complete report. <br />
There's no need to remember the exact query format because Teambot will remind you of that. <br />
![query](https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/14814/files/bb732400-1aa6-11ea-858f-73d2f5a5a6ce) <br />
The example query below asks for the number of commits of the user @mngr1 within the period 11/01/2019 - 12/03/2019. <br />
![commit](https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/14814/files/db571780-1aa7-11ea-88cf-46005934cf04) <br />
Then you get a brief answer: <br />
